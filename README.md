# labor
The labour.csv dataset will be studied.  This dataset provides information about workers. It takes into account characteristics such as working hours, annual wage increases, holidays and leave, health and other benefits, and as a result tells us whether the working environment or conditions are good or bad. 

These data were collected through labour negotiations in Canadian industry. The data contains 57 records, 16 characteristics and 1 class column. The class column is used to learn whether a contract is good or bad for an employee's working environment. The values in the dataset are either numeric or categorical (nominal).
